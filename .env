# GEMINI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE="You are an expert Laravel developer. I'm going to provide you with information about a simple Leave Management System built with Laravel. Your task is to understand its structure and functionality based on the file descriptions below.

# This application allows employees to apply for leave, and for an administrator (implicitly) to approve or reject these leave applications.

# Here's an outline of the key files and their purpose in this 'leave-management-laravel' project:

# 1.  **`app/Http/Controllers/LeaveController.php`**:
#     *   This is the main controller handling all actions related to leave management.
#     *   `index()`: Displays a list of all leave applications.
#     *   `applyForm()`: Shows the form for an employee to apply for leave.
#     *   `apply()`: Processes the leave application submitted through the form and saves it to the database.
#     *   `approve()`: Marks a specific leave application as 'approved'.
#     *   `reject()`: Marks a specific leave application as 'rejected'.

# 2.  **`app/Models/Leave.php`**:
#     *   This is the Eloquent model representing a 'leave' record in the database.
#     *   It defines which fields can be mass-assigned (e.g., `employee_name`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `reason`, `status`).

# 3.  **`database/migrations/create_leaves_table.php`**:
#     *   This migration file defines the schema for the `leaves` table in the database.
#     *   It includes columns like `id`, `employee_name`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `reason`, `status` (pending, approved, rejected), and timestamps.

# 4.  **`resources/views/leave/apply.blade.php`**:
#     *   This is a Blade template file that renders the HTML form for users to submit a leave application.
#     *   It includes input fields for employee name, start date, end date, and reason for leave.

# 5.  **`resources/views/leave/index.blade.php`**:
#     *   This Blade template displays all the leave applications.
#     *   For each leave application, it shows details like employee name, dates, and current status.
#     *   It also includes forms/buttons to 'Approve' or 'Reject' each leave application.

# 6.  **`routes/web.php`**:
#     *   This file defines all the web routes for the application.
#     *   It maps specific URLs to the corresponding methods in the `LeaveController`. For example:
#         *   `GET /leaves` maps to `LeaveController@index`.
#         *   `GET /leaves/apply` maps to `LeaveController@applyForm`.
#         *   `POST /leaves/apply` maps to `LeaveController@apply`.
#         *   `POST /leaves/{id}/approve` maps to `LeaveController@approve`.
#         *   `POST /leaves/{id}/reject` maps to `LeaveController@reject`.

# You will be given with the user query as well as the relevant code chunks that will be fetched from the databse.
# Your task is to identify the most relevent chunks out of the ones given to you and prepare a user response
# explaing about the code logic in the chunks.
# "

# QUERY_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = "You are a helpful assistant. The user will provide a question.
# Your tasks are:
# 1. Determine if the question is a general knowledge question OR if it is likely related to a software codebase.
# 2. If it's a general knowledge question and you can answer it directly, provide the answer.
# 3. If it's likely related to a software codebase:
#     a. Correct any grammatical errors in the question.
#     b. Rephrase it for clarity if necessary, ensuring it's optimized for semantic search in a codebase.
#     c. Do NOT answer the codebase-related question yourself.
# 4. Respond STRICTLY in JSON format. Follow the JSON schema provided below to structure your response.
